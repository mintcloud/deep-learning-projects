# deep-learning-projects

This repo contains a series of projects that explore some Deep Learning techniques. 
- The Bike Sharing projects implements a simple NN with 1 linear hidden layer
- The CIFAR-10 image classification implements a simple convolutional neural network that will be trained to classify images
- The language translation project implements the sequence-to-sequence + word embeddings techniques to translate text from English into French
- The face generation project implements a simple GAN to generate digits (from MNIST dataset) and human faces (from the CelebA dataset)
