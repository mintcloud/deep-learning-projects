# Deep Learning projects

This repo contains a series of projects that explore some Deep Learning techniques. They are all in forms of jupyter notebook, utilizing Tensorflow as the main NN API library.

- The Bike Sharing projects implements a simple NN with 1 linear hidden layer.
- The CIFAR-10 image classification implements a simple convolutional neural network that will be trained to classify images.
- The Simpons script generator implements a RNN (utilizing LSTM cells) to generate a script for the famous TV show.
- The language translation project implements the sequence-to-sequence technique to translate text sequences from English into French.
- The face generation project implements a simple GAN to generate digits (from MNIST dataset) and human faces (from the CelebA dataset)

These projects were developed during Udacity's "Deep Learning" nanodegree.
